## In this project I have used the following things 
***
#### React
#### Firebase / Firestore
#### Redux to make everything work smoothly. 
#### Materialize CSS for an fast and easy design.

I wasn't foccused on making it responsive yet, I know how to make it responsive ect but I have zero experience with Firebase/NodeJS that was where I mainly was focused on. Even tho I only had the add task function I have learned a lot from this assignment. I have a little experience with react native but not by using loops or switch cases, which I also learned in this assignment. I've used sum tutorials to make the login but it wasn't working so now I'm just doing research on how I could make that part.

Things my assignment can do already
